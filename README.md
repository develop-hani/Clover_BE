## Technologies
- ubuntu 20.04
- Java 11.0.17
- Spring Boot 2.7.5
- Gradle 7.1.1
- MySQL
- AWS - EC2, RDS

## Difficulties and workarounds in implementation
- Executing Python module.
  - It couldn't be solved using 'Jython'. This is because Python packages such as numpy and pandas could not be run.
  - Implementing through aws ec2 instance(ubuntu) worked. The relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/pyh-dotcom/clover_backend/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/clover_backend/service/ExecutePython.java).
- Building a Spring Boot project via terminal.
  - Solved by allocating memory as swap space by using a swap file.
